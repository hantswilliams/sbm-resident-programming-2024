## Installing VS Code

The best way of installing VS Code is by visiting code.visualstudio.com and downloading the latest version of VS Code.

From here, we will then configure VS Code to work with Python.

### Step 1: Install Python Extension

The first step is to install the Python extension for VS Code. This can be done by clicking on the Extensions icon on the left-hand side of the VS Code window and searching for Python.

### Configure Python Interpreter

The next step is to configure the Python interpreter. This can be done by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left-hand corner of the VS Code window and selecting the Python interpreter you would like to use. 

Or by doing `SHIFT + CMD + P` and typing "Python: Select Interpreter" and selecting the Python interpreter you would like to use.

### Step 2: Install GitKracken for Version Control

The next step is to install GitKraken for version control. This can be done by visiting gitkraken.com and downloading the latest version of GitKraken.

For this, we can also register our github user account 'as a student', and get the pro version for free.
